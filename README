# elasticoSolr

Software to query our log files search engine from the shell. 
. Needs to see psmetric04
. Currently installed in psmetric01 

This software is a port of the previous 'elastico' from Elasticsearch to Solr.

Retrocompatibility was one of my first objectives so most of Elastico documentation suold be still relevant. Either the manpage or the webpages. 

Elastico full documentation is here: https://slac-lcls.github.io/elastico/
